Hello !

Here are my solutions.
I chose these problems:
  6 - Steganography 101
  8 - Best Scrabble Opening

The solutions are in their own folders.
They can be run with any Ruby >= 1.9.2

6 - Steganography 101:

The Bitmap class is very restricted for the format, but it should handle all logical inputs for the problem.
Also, it will warn if one of the conditions is not met:
- 8-bits color depth (black and white image)
- not compressed
- positive height
- invalid header

It also handles row padding as explained in the Wikipedia article (see the file input513x513.bmp).

Usage is:
$ ruby stenography.rb input.bmp output.bmp [message file]
If no message is passed, the image is kept as is. This allows to test parsing/writing.

8 - Best Scrabble Opening

The algorithm used is quite simple: find the maximum score, for every possible word, at every possible position.
It uses a custom method max_by_keys, which is a Enumerable#max_by enhanced.
This helps to keep the word and position while maximizing the score.

The objects of class Place are mutable, and calling #next! will give the next place, following their direction attribute.

Usage is:
$ ruby best_scrabble_opening.rb input.json
