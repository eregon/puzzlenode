4 - Robots vs Lasers

This problem was pretty simple, but *very* enjoyable.

robots.rb is the solution.
It focuses on nice tricks to have some unusual looking solution, while the logic behind should be easy to read.
One of the highlight could be:
  go[direction] if damages[other[direction]] > damages[direction]


robots_pm.rb is the same solution, but use some 'Proc Maker' goodness.
This allows to create blocks "a la" Symbol#to_proc, but in a more flexible way.

Compare
  lasers = [north, south].map { |side| side.chars.map { |c| c == '|' } }
and
  lasers = [north, south].map(&P.chars.map(&P == '|'))
